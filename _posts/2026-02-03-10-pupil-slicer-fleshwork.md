# Pupil Slicer - Fleshwork

Bass forward mix from the off, like that. Shrieky almost ATG style vocals is cool.

Use of synths for texture, mixed relatively low is pretty sweet.

Parts of Innocence sounded like the sound used for the main motif in the Final Fantasy 8 Lunatic Pandora soundtrack.

This album is unrelenting, savage, angry as all hell. Seriously short and sweet, 36 minutes of raging, roiling, blackened grindy metal.
