# Kataklysm - Epic: The Poetry of War

This is an album of pretty unrelenting heaviness in one form or other, and it does somewhat run the gamut.
From serious Gothenburg inflected blasting harmonies, through mid-paced grind, and at times almost blackened melodeath, this is gooooood.

Greatly enjoyed from start to finish.
