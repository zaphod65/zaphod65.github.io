# David Bowie - Blackstar

His final release, which came out only a few days before his death; this release is so close as to render it basically posthumous

The opening track is a very open arrangement, light vocal work, unusual harmonies. Nice sax lead work. Maybe it's because I don't know and historically haven't liked his work, but this doesn't sound like what I recognise as Bowie. It's still definitely his voice, but the song is different. Then dammit, half way through the track it turned in to a much more normal Bowie song, how disappointing. End of the sing almost feels like old British prog, King Crimson or something, much more entertaining to me.

Track two... Why you gotta be like that man? And the song isn't interesting either.

Lazarus, moody bass, sombre sax lines, some cool guitar stabs. By the end of this track, all the best parts of the album have been when Bowie himself shuts up.

Its only 41 minutes, how does this album manage to drag? The songs both don't go anywhere and repeat too much with ideas that aren't interesting enough to bear this much listening at once.

For something so critically loved I hoped this would convert me to a Bowie fan, but this hasn't achieved it unfortunately.
