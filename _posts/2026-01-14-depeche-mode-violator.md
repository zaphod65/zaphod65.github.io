## Depeche Mode - Violator

Oh I like this.  Full of dark synths, the easily recognisable vocals, sparse but not empty arrangements.

The two smash singles, Personal Jesus and Enjoy The Silence, are definitely the most immediately energetic songs on the album, but not strictly highlights for me.  Opener World In My Eyes really sets the tone with a slow build of layers to a wonderfully moody ending.

It feels like more Depeche Mode is on the cards for the rest of the year, this one is great.
