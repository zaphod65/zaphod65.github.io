## The aim here

It's time for me to listen to more music.  Specifically more music I haven't heard before.

To that end, I want to try and listen to one new album, in full, for every week of 2026.  It's important to note that by "new", I don't mean newly released, only new _to me_.  In fact I kind of expect this to lean more on classic albums I've not listened to before than new releases by the end of it.

I'm going to try and document that here, both to track what I've actually been listening to, and to try and make sure I actually do it.  I have a habit of not doing things I know I want to and that I know would be nice.  __I Don't want to lose this one.__

So... here we go!
