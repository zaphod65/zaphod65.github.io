## The Cure - Pornography

So an album by The Cure that isn't Disintagration.  It's still really good.

The elements are all there; bass-forward arrangements, romantically dark lyrics in Robert Smith's signature style, jangly guitar work, atmospheric synth arrangements.  As you might expect, though, it's all just a bit less refined than it would later become.  Of course that was always going to be true, and comparing this to something like Disintagration is always going to be unfair, given what an absolute monument that album is.  This is a signpost, though, to what the band would later achieve, it just needed a little more time to mature and grow.

Again, though, I really did enjoy this as a full listening experience, and I think that would be the best way to take this in.  There aren't the big single moments like Lovesong or Just Like Heaven, but that just means this will reward complete listens I think, and that's what I intend to do in the next few weeks so I can appreciate this properly.
