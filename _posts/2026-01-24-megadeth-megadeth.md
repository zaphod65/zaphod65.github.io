## Megadeth - Megadeth

So Megadave is calling it quits, apparently, and this is to be his last release.  Between his advancing age and reported health problems, it seems this one might actually stick, unlike the other big names who have tried to call time on their careers and just kept running another 'final tour'.

The albums is... fine, I guess.  It's fun in places, tracks like 'Let There Be Shred' certainly doing what you expect from a Megadeth song.  There's nothing here that's going to make new fans of anyone, but the current lineup certainly perform very well, and while the songs don't have the sheer energy of the classic releases... I enjoyed this one.
