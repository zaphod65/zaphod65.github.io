## Testament - Para Bellum

There's so much here, from breakneck opener 'For The Love Of Pain', to almost power-ballad 'Meant To Be'.  The band draw on so many influences both sounding like truly old-school thrash in places to blast-beat filled sections that wouldn't be out of place on a death or black metal album.  Guitar work from Alex Skolnick is viciously on-point as well, shredding with the energy of a man half his age.

This album is what happens when a classic thrash band doesn't sit around writing the same music for nearly 40 years.
