# Bad Bunny - Debí Tirar Más Fotos

I'm not usually one for reggaeton.  It's not like I dislike it, I just don't get it... this one was a wholly unexpected experience.

Between the really different instruments, unusual beats, and Bad Bunny's vocal delivery, I really enjoyed this, and will be coming back to it later with a translation of the lyrics.  I believe they cover a range of topics unusual to the genre, so that's something I want to get my head around.  From his performance at the 2026 Superbowl, I'm not surprised.  I think I'm kind of hooked?!
