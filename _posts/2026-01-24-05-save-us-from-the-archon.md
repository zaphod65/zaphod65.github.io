## Save Us From The Archon - How Terrible, The Undergrowth's Jaws That Tangle

RIFFS.  Fuckin' RIFFS.  For _days_.

This is some pretty savage instrumental metal, from the blistering start to the brutal end.  It's difficult to pick out a stand out moment, but that's a good thing: nothing was a giant clanger either.

Need to take this in again, really enjoyed it but I was also in an airport going to my flight, so I'd like to give it a closer listen when I can.
