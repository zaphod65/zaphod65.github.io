## Death - Scream Bloody Gore

So I love this band, the 4 albums up to the end of the band (Individual Thought Patterns, Symbolic, Human, The Sound Of Perseverance) are some of my absolute favourite death metal albums.  I haven't, until this point, been back to listen to the origins of the band; the gore and horror era, as it were.

I have to say... while I'm not disappointed strictly, this is nowhere near as much to my taste as their later work.  It's fine, but definitely more of a late thrash album than really death metal.  The Slayer worship is pretty front and centre, and it doesn't have the same songwriting sophistication that would mark where Death would end up going.

Don't get me wrong: Chuck's riffs and harmonies are there, his trademark harsh vocal sound.  But it's all a bit... nascent.  Prototypical.  Not the benchmark by which all others should be judged which I consider something like Human to be.
