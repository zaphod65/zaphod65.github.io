# Kate Bush - The Dreaming

Altogether more jaunty than something like Hounds Of Love but the elements are there - synth arrangements, the voice and vocal harmonies, production as an instrument.

Its weird, this album still feels like Bush is trying to find her identity somehow, despite the fact that all her hallmarks are here. The vocal delivery doesn't feel fully formed somehow.

I still like this, it just feels... A bit off-kilter. Lacks the fullness of what would come on Hounds Of Love. But then again, that's probably unfair, Hounds is a certifiable classic.

Then Night Of The Swallow came on, this immediately feels like this is where she hit her stride writing for the album.

The back half of this album is where it comes alive, the songs feel less silly and more considered.

Get Out Of My House guitar feels very David Gilmour, which is interesting because he's not credited as a guitarist or writer on the album even though he did provide some backing vocals for one song.
